AutoFrontend is a framework for automaticaly builing UI applications based on custom businees logic

## Why this framework could be useful for you?

Some use cases:

1. For prototyping. If you need to create prototype of some UI applciation in a very fast way.
2. For initial development phase.
   Good approach to build new applciation is to **start from business logic and build custom UI later** when BL will have more final shape.
3. For builing test\admin\internal usage applications. These types of applications often do not require custom UI. Often it should just works. Typical applications: test client apps, test data generators, token generators, e.t.c
