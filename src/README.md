# Overview

AutoFrontend is a framework for automatically building UI applications based on custom business logic

## Why this framework could be useful for you?

1. For prototyping. If you need to create prototype of some UI application in a very fast way.

2. For initial development phase.  
   If you want to **start from business logic and build custom UI later** when BL will have more final shape.

3. For building test data generators.
   These types of applications often do not require custom UI. Often it should just works.

4. For building test\admin\internal usage applications.  
   Typical examples: test client apps for some services, token generators, admin tools, e.t.c
